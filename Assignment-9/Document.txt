Fristly I implement all of html part, its create a demo then lastly I create design part
means CSS.One of the biggest challenges of creating a blog is designing and customizing 
it to meet your specific needs because I am beginner about CSS. If you don't have
a background in design, this can be a easy task. One solution is to use pre-designed
templates and themes that can be customized to your liking.But I use raw CSS
for this design.Another challenge is creating content that is engaging and informative.
This can be overcome by conducting thorough research on this blog topic.And Finally
I create a basic blog site What you needed.
